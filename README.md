Android app launcher for iOS.

Drop in an APK, tap it, and the Android app opens full-screen.

## No-JIT variant

`HUSK_NO_JIT=1` builds a separate `Husk-NoJIT.ipa` using the pinned QEMU TCI
interpreter, with no debugger, StikJIT or pairing path. The existing Android
VM and ANGLE/Metal stack are retained. See [docs/nojit.md](docs/nojit.md) for
build/install instructions and the distinction between host tests and physical
iPhone validation. The [No-JIT workflow](.github/workflows/nojit.yml) publishes
the IPA and an offline smoke-test APK; device boot is not certified by CI.

## JIT

Husk needs JIT, which on iOS takes an attached debugger. Use StikDebug, or
Husk's built-in StikJIT helper (iOS 26+), which on iOS 27 can pair with your
iPhone from Settings with no computer. The app walks you through it; see
[docs/06-built-in-jit.md](docs/06-built-in-jit.md).

## Builds

Every push builds an unsigned `Husk.ipa` in GitHub Actions
([build-ipa.yml](.github/workflows/build-ipa.yml)). It is attached to the run
as an artifact, ready for AltStore, SideStore or TrollStore to sign and
install. The first run builds QEMU and its dependencies from scratch, which
takes a couple of hours; after that they are cached.

## Licence

GPL-2.0-or-later. Husk links QEMU, which is GPLv2, so the shipped binary is a
combined GPLv2 work and the full source is public. It cannot go on the App
Store — both because of that and because it needs `get-task-allow` plus a
debugger attaching at runtime. See [docs/01-licensing.md](docs/01-licensing.md).
